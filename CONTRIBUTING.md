# Hacktoverfest 2019
Welcome to the month of learning, sharing, and raising PRs. Being a developer and active community person I keep getting lot of questions
from where to start for contribution. Hence, here it is my repo of CSS3 examples open for contribution for first-timer or seasoned 
CSS developers or anyone who is learning CSS.

## Rules:
- Be very very nice
- Have empathy
- Remember goal is to __learn and share__ not to prove __who is more smarter__
- If stuck ask for help. Trust me there is no issue is asking help.

## Where to start contributing?
- Documentation
- Pipelines (may be??)
- New features, modules suggestions 
- PR for pending tasks
- move to issue tab

## Who I am?
I am Neha Sharma, a curious and learner. Here is my [twitter](https://twitter.com/hellonehha) account.
